# Anaconda has moved on to Qt5, but CASA requires Qt4. We can't just rely on
# the existing Anaconda Qt4 package, though, because since it was last built
# the conda build system was changed to use longer paths, so we can't build
# new packages that depend on the old version. Fun times. We also include
# DBus support on OS X, which is not included in the stock version, likely
# because dbus-cxx is totally busted.
#
# el-capitan.patch is from
# https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/qt.rb
